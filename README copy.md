# Prompt Engineer or Prompt Generator

This project is a modular, documentation-driven prompt engineering system for generating, refining, and managing prompts. All logic and workflow are managed through structured markdown filesâ€”no code execution or build system is present. The system is designed for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility, with each major concern isolated in its own file.

## Key Concepts

- **Declarative Workflow**: All instructions, context, commands, templates, and profiles are defined in markdown or structured text files. There is no executable code; the system is configuration- and documentation-driven.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each concern (instructions, context, commands, templates, profiles) is managed in a dedicated file or directory.
- **Cross-file Consistency**: When updating commands, templates, or context, always update related files to maintain consistency.
- **Extensible Profiles**: Agent and workflow profiles allow for rapid switching and customization of prompt engineering strategies.

## Project Structure

- `main_instruction.md`: Central JSON configuration and system instructions. Defines the workflow, user interaction steps, and restrictions.
- `context/context.md`: Domain-specific context, best practices, prompt formats, paradigms, and techniques.
- `commands/commands.md`: All available commands, their syntax, and descriptions for workflow automation.
- `profiles/`: Agent and workflow profiles for customizing prompt generation strategies (see `profiles/profile.md`).
- `templates/templates.md` & `templates/subcomponents/templates-context.md`: Prompt templates, subcomponents, and detailed prompting techniques with examples.
- `metadata.md`: System metadata, author, version, and project description.
- `changelog.md`: Tracks all significant changes and version history.
- `glossary.md`: Defines key terms and concepts for prompt engineering.
- `contributing.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Core Workflow (from `main_instruction.md`)

1. **Task Selection**: Choose the prompt task (Create, Enhance, Modify, Custom, Agent, or /auto). The system supports both shortcut keys and free-form mapping.
2. **Format Selection**: Select the desired prompt format (plain text, JSON, YAML, markdown, etc.), or use `/auto` for automatic selection.
3. **Technique Selection**: Choose prompt engineering techniques (e.g., Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, etc.), or `/auto`.
4. **Paradigm Selection**: Select the paradigm (Agent-based, Reasoning-based, Symbolic/GOFAI, etc.), or `/auto`.
5. **Save/Commit**: Use `/save` or `/commit` to persist your workflow state for the current chat session.
6. **Iterative Improvement**: The system supports feedback-driven refinement and multiple-choice feedback collection.
7. **Documentation**: All prompt choices and results are output in code blocks for clarity and traceability.

## Context & Best Practices (from `context/context.md`)

- Use the latest, most capable models for best results.
- Place instructions at the beginning of prompts and use clear separators.
- Be specific and detailed about context, outcome, format, and style.
- Articulate output format through examples.
- Start with zero-shot, then few-shot, then fine-tune if needed.
- Reduce imprecise descriptions and always specify what to do instead of what not to do.
- Use leading words for code generation and provide explicit format requirements.

### Supported Formats

- XML, JSON, YAML, Markdown, Table (Markdown Table), CSV, INI

### Supported Paradigms

- Agent-based, Reasoning-based, Symbolic (Classic/GOFAI)

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

- Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, Meta Prompting, Self-Consistency, Generate Knowledge, Prompt Chaining, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use, Automatic Prompt Engineer, Active-Prompt, Directional Stimulus Prompting, Program-Aided Language Models, ReAct, Reflexion, Multimodal CoT, Graph Prompting, and more (see templates and context for details).

## Commands (from `commands/commands.md`)

The system supports a rich set of commands for managing prompts, templates, context, profiles, and workflow. Key commands include:

- `/save` or `/commit`: Save current workflow state for the session.
- `/create`, `/modify`, `/delete`: Manage prompts, templates, commands, or context entries.
- `/validate`: Check structure and content for correctness.
- `/auto`: Let the system choose the best options.
- `/init`, `/start`, `/help`: Display commands, agent info, and help.
- `/templates`, `/context`, `/glossary`, `/metadata`, `/reference`, `/format`, `/paradigm`, `/agent`, `/examples`, `/readme`, `/update`, `/history`, `/profile`, `/show_changelog`, `/list_commands`, `/search [keyword]`, `/about`, `/version`.

See `commands/commands.md` for the full list and descriptions.

## Profiles (from `profiles/profile.md`)

Profiles define reusable configurations for agent behavior and prompt generation. Each profile specifies task, format, technique, and paradigm, supporting both auto and explicit settings. Example profiles:

- `agent_basic_auto`: All steps set to auto.
- `create_zero_shot_json`: Create task, JSON format, Zero-shot technique, Reasoning-based paradigm.
- `enhance_few_shot_markdown`: Enhance task, Markdown format, Few-shot technique, Agent-based paradigm.

See `profiles/profile.md` for more.

## Templates & Subcomponents

Templates define reusable prompt structures and techniques. Subcomponents provide detailed examples and advanced prompting strategies. See `templates/templates.md` and `templates/subcomponents/templates-context.md` for:

- Prompting techniques (Zero-shot, Few-shot, CoT, etc.)
- Format examples (JSON, YAML, Markdown, etc.)
- Paradigm and technique options
